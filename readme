Letter from AWS:
ACTION REQUIRED: Your AWS Access Key is Exposed for AWS Account 433794210833
Dear AWS Customer,

We are following up with you, as your AWS Account may still be compromised. Please review the previous notice we have sent and take immediate action to secure your account. If you believe that your account is secured and there is no unauthorized access or usage, please contact us immediately by responding to this Support case.

This account compromise poses a security risk to your account (including other account users), and could lead to excessive charges from unauthorized activity. To protect your account from excessive charges, we have temporarily limited your ability to use some AWS services. To remove the limits, please follow the instructions provided in our initial notice.

If the unauthorized usage is not stopped we may suspend your AWS account. To further protect your account from excessive charges, we may terminate any suspected unauthorized resources on your account.

If you have any questions, please contact us by responding through this Support case.
